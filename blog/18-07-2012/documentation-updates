  <h3>Major Updates to Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    Over the last few weeks I have invested quite a bit of time updating the documentation. I'm not a technical writer, hell, I wouldn't call myself much
    of a writer at all so Ive struggled with this somewhat, but it is slowly getting there.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the better things to come out of this exercise is the realisation that the framework is really starting to get to the point where people might
    start to find it useful. I have also discovered numerous issues while documenting things, most of which have been patched as they where discovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    These updates see the documentation organised better than it was previously with some quick <em>overview</em> type guides up first before delving into more
    detailed text as you read on.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>The menu on the left follows a path that means reading each of the pages linked to from top to bottom should progress through the frameworks functionality in a reasonably linear fashion.</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Another addition is indeed this blog. Here I plan on announcing news, articles and maybe some stuff about related projects.
